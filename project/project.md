# The Guideline for the Final Project

The final project is a major component of this course. Each project are expected to develop a digital-geographies related project. It can be a web map, a smart dashboard, a geo-narrative, or a project idea which has been approved by the instructor. All the final projects are expected to **publish online**, and the **codes are expected to be shared on GitHub** to contribute to both the open source community and academia. The final project must satisfy the follwoing items:

- Host your project on github. By doing so, your project can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`.

- In addition to the main feature of the digital-geographies (e.g. web map, smart dashboard or geo-narrative), you should also show the project title, a short description, legend, data sources, and acknowledgement at easily found places on the web page.

- A `readme.md` describes your web map, including, but not limited to,
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?)
    - Data sources
    - Applied libraries (e.g., Leaflet, D3, C3) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use
    - Other things necessary to inform the audience.
    - Acknowledgement

## 2\. Presentation

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback.

We will hold a final presentation meeting **on March 16th, 4:30 to 7:30PM**, each student is expected to present the final project in ~3 minutes, and plus another 1 minute for Q&A session.

## 3\. Peer Review
During the final presentation, each student will need to share some constructive comments to at least **FIVE** of your class mates's final projects. The comments needs to be submitted as a new github issue to the presenter's final project repository. Your comment could start with something the presenter did well, and the list a few items the presenter could further improve.

## 4\. Submission

To submit your final project, you will need to share the url link of your final project's github repository to a dedicated final project submission tab on Canvas by the end of the finals week on Friday(March 19th) by 11:59pm.


>  **Note:** The requirements to the project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
