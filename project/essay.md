 Through writing this essay, you are expected to use the learned knowledge and skill set to holistically examine the project's functions and critically reflect upon its social implications. This essay can be simple and focus in nature, but must include the following features:

- create a dedicated github repository, and write this essay on a readme.md file of this repo.
