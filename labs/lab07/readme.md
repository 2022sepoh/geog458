In this lab, you will learn how to create a online Geo-Narrative and then create a map-based storytelling project all by yourself. A GeoNarrative application, also being referred to as storymap, or map-based storytelling, is an visualization genre that primarily utilizes a series of maps or other types of geovisualizations to narrate a geographical event or phenomenon. In addition to geovisualization, there will be other form of information like scripts, images, or videos. This lecture mainly provides an online GeoNarrative template which can help you to make your own geo-narrative applications. To review the geo-narrative template, please visit [this link](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog458/weeks/week07).
