# Lab 4: Map Design and Tile Generation

**Instructor:** Bo Zhao, 206.685.3846 or zhaobo@uw.edu; **Points Available** = 50

In this lab, please walk through the [Participatory mapping project](https://github.com/jakobzhao/participatory-mapping) tutorial. This tutorial helps geographers to create their own participatory mapping project. It offers a map demo (https://jakobzhao.github.io/participatory-mapping/, see figure 1) and a detailed instruction on how to create it. This map demo enables its users to contribute their local knowledge by clicking on a map, inputting their information, and viewing their input represented as a red dot. Existing contributions can also be viewed in a similar manner on the map. While this minimum viable map only offers essential functionality, it can be tailored or expanded to suit different participatory mapping initiatives. This approach can be particularly beneficial for digital geographers who want to kick-start their own participatory mapping projects. This lab will be an opportunity to make a template for your final project of this course.

For your deliverable, you need to make a participatory mapping project all by yourself. Your map should target a specific group of people. For example, you can make a participatory mapping project for the LGBTQ+ community, or for the Black History Month, or for the UW community, or for the Nature/Environment, etc. When you determine the targeting group, make sure the use of language on the information panel and the map style are relevant to the group. (20 POINTS).

 Below are a few other requirement.
   
   - the existing participatory mapping template enable users to input user name and the message, please incoperate new fields. For example, you can add a field to collect the contributor's email address. (5 POINTS)

   - update the style of the visualized dots on the map. (5 POINTS)
   - user can contribute to this map and the contributed data should be stored in a database and properly visualized on the map. (15 POINTS)
   - make sure the repository accessible through the url `https://[your_github_username].github.io/[your_repository_name]`. Also, please provide the url to your webmap in the `readme.md` file. (5 POINTS).

Please make sure the internal structure of the files in your project repository is well organized. For example, it may be similar to the file structure below.

```powershell
[your_repository_name]
    │index.html
    │readme.md
    ├─css
    │      style.css
    ├─img
    │      xxx.jpg
    └─js
            main.js
```
