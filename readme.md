Embrace the power of technology and join us on a journey into the dynamic world of digital geographies! This course is designed to equip students with the technical skills that are in high demand in emerging job markets, while also providing a unique opportunity to explore the latest emerging digital methods and technologies. By building holistic solutions to real-world problems and critically analyzing their social implications, students will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of the digital age. Through a full range of theoretical perspectives and practical exercises, students will learn everything from geospatial project management using GitHub to online geovisualization. Along the way, they will delve into a series of geospatial data operations and analyses, such as acquiring online data (e.g., geo-tagged tweets), geocoding, and performing geospatial analyses. With a brief introduction to web programming basics (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, and CSS), students will even learn how to visualize and narrate geographic phenomena online.

But that's not all! This course will also introduce students to a range of state-of-the-art approaches and applications in digital geographies, such as collecting aerial imagery and point clouds using UAVs or LiDAR, and storing real-time data from environmental sensors. As we approach the end of the quarter, we'll delve into newly emerged issues in digital geographies, such as the problematic use of artificial intelligence and the role of blockchain in geospatial contexts. By the end of this course, students will not only have mastered a range of technical skills that are important to many emerging jobs, but also honed their critical intellectual visions on the social implications of these applied techniques.

This course is designed to be highly interactive and hands-on. Most of the course time will be spent in a hybrid lecture/lab setting, where students will have the opportunity to work together and apply their knowledge in a practical setting. While there will be some individual written reflections and analyses, there will not be a formal final exam. Instead, students will be tasked with completing a final project that allows them to develop a holistic solution to a real-world problem. Upon completion of the course, each student will have the opportunity to share their course work on a self-made website, which will be publicly accessible to classmates, the open-source community, and potential industrial recruiters. In addition to practical skills, students will also be exposed to a range of applied and theoretical readings. These readings will cover both the technical aspects of programming and visualization, as well as critical social theory, providing students with a well-rounded understanding of the field and helping them to make informed, effective, and inclusive decisions in today's data-intensive geographic world. By the end of the course, students will have gained a wealth of knowledge and practical experience that will set them up for success in their future endeavors.

## :flags: Learning Objectives

- To understand how computational and networked approaches can transform the methods, sociology, and objects of geographical inquiry.

- To learn how to find, evaluate, use, extend, and combine various methods and tools of digital geography as needed for a given task. These tools may include GitHub, QGIS, Python, JavaScript, and Mapbox.

Therefore, it is crucial that all students participate in the lab sessions during this week. ** Additionally, the instructor will be available for virtual meetings during normal lecture and office hours in Weeks 9 and 10 for troubleshooting and to offer assistance with the final projects. These meetings can be accessed via the [Zoom link](https://washington.zoom.us/my/bzhao) provided for lectures and by scheduling an appointment through the designated [link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUZvU2gxXzVlZnZpfGRlZmF1bHR8NzM4ODA5MzUyNjAxZDU2Y2ViNTZiMzk2ZmM0N2VmNzI) for office hours. If neither of these time slots is convenient, please contact the instructor to arrange a meeting at a mutually available time.

During these two weeks, each group will focus on their final projects, with the instructor and TAs available to provide support during normal lecture periods, lab sessions, and office hours. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help along the way.

### Finals Week : Final project presentations

TBD.

## :bell: Course Requirement

**E-mail:** is the easiest way of reaching me. I will respond to all e-mails during office hours, and will periodically return e-mail at other times. Please note that the answer to many commonly e-mailed questions can be found in the syllabus or on the course website. Please also note that in order to respond your e-mail you MUST include the following information in every e-mail:


    -  A Salutation (Both Dr. Zhao and Professor Zhao are acceptable)
    -  Your Full Name
    -  What class you are in
    -  Subject line summarizing your e-mail (i.e. “Question regarding Map Design” for example)

`For all the questions related to quizzes and labs, please contact the TA.`

**GitHub:** The course material will be hosted on GitHub instead of UW Canvas. On this dedicated GitHub repository, you can find most of the course material, participate in group discussions by submitting GitHub issues, and create new GitHub repositories to turn in the lab deliverables. By the end of this quarter, you will be more proficient in operating a cloud-based coding environment and able to host your work online as a way to gain public and peer attentions.

**Labs:** You need to finish all four labs by the due date. In order to help you work on each lab, we will walk through most of the labs in class.

**Think Pieces:** for week 1 to 8, there will be weekly reading assignments. To evaluate your reflection upon each week's reading material, we set up a discussion board for each week. You need to submit at least think pieces to **4** out of the 8 weeks' discussion topics. We will review them all, but only the four with hightest scores will be counted towards your final grade. Your think pieces should be completed by Thursday @ 11:59 pm for the weeks you are submitting a piece. **All the 4 think pieces must be submitted by the end of Week 8**. Your think pieces should be at least 350 words and engage substantially with the reading materials, and connections to the lab assignments and lectures. Guiding questions or prompts will be included in each week's discussion section on canvas to help frame your thinking. Submit your think pieces on Canvas in the applicable week's discussion section (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1434645/discussion_topics).

**Class participation:** Complete all assigned readings and get familiar with the lab instructions before class meetings, and actively participate in critical discussions of those readings. You should have completed all of the weekly readings before our Friday lab sections as these sections will be devoted to critical discussion and engagement with the required readings.

**In-class presentation:** **Also, each group will lead the presentation about an assigned topic at least once throughout this quarter. We will start assign the group presentation assignment in Week 3.** Each group will present an previously assign paper or a digital geography related project in no more than 10 minutes. If you prepare slides for the presentation, please send it to the instructor before class via email.

**Final Project:** will be conducted by a group of 4 to 5 students who are from the same Lab session. It needs to be submitted by June 8th, 11:59pm. Check out [the detailed requirement for final project](project/readme.md).
