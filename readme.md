As digital technologies have radically transformed human life, this course tries to engage students in this digitally mediated and data-intensive geographic world, and also train them the timely technical skills which are demanding in emerging job markets. This course will provide a unique opportunity to explore emerging digital methods, to build a holistic solution to real-world problems, and to critically analyze their social implications. Rather than focusing exclusively on one or two specific topics, this course covers a full range of theoretical perspectives and practical exercises. The course begins with teaching students on geospatial project management using GitHub, and then a series of geospatial data operations and analyses are covered in detail, such as online data (e.g., geotagged tweets) acquisition, geocoding, spatial and placial analyses. With these preparations, this course switches to online geovisualization. After a brief introduction to web programming basics (e.g., JavaScript, Html, and CSS), students will learn how to visualize and narrate geographic phenomena in an online environment. A few state-of-the-art approaches and applications in digital geographies will be practiced, such as collecting aerial imagery and point clouds using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, commonly known as drone) or LiDAR, making virtual reality (VR) of geographic environments, as well as storing real-time data from an environmental sensor. Throughout, students will be empowered not only with defined skills that will be important to many emerging jobs, but also with critical intellectual vision. This course is very “hands-on” and interactive! Most of our time will be spent in a hybrid lecture/lab where students will be working together. Although there will be some individual written reflections and analyses, no formal written final exam will be set up. The final project enables students to work collaboratively to figure out a holistic solution to researching a real-world problem. With the completion of this course, each student can share the course work at a self-made website which can be publicly viewed by classmates, open-source community as well as future industrial recruiters. Along the way, the readings will include both applied and theoretical selections. Students will learn not only how people have been programming and visualizing, but also about how critical social theorists have identified assumptions, ideologies, and rigidities in existing practices that can help students to make effective, inclusive and empathetic decisions in today’s data-intensive geographic world.

## :flags: Learning Objectives

-   To identify when and how the methods, sociology, and objects of geographical inquiry can be transformed through computational and networked approaches.

-   To learn to find, evaluate, use, extend, and combine various methods and tools of digital geography as needed for a given task. Recently, examples of such tools have included: GitHub, QGIS, Python, JavaScript, Mapbox, Unity, Gephi.

-   To practice and reflect theoretically upon emerging born-digital, multi-modal, narrative, and interactive approaches to cartography and scholarly communication.

-   To reflect on the iterative and social dimensions to one’s own learning process.
