The interactive map of the CHOP (https://hgis.uw.edu/chop) allows users to contribute their personal perspectives to the platform. This method, known as Participatory Mapping, involves using online mapping tools to gather data from non-experts. It can aid different stakeholders to enhance their geospatial databases and can be seen as a way to integrate critical and participatory approaches in GIS. This exercise will give you the chance to experience participatory mapping and consider important factors to keep in mind during development, as well as its potential impact on society. I hope this exercise will inspire you to consider incorporating a participatory mapping component in your future projects.

To earn the extra credit, you can contribute to the  map following these steps:

1. Open the website (https://hgis.uw.edu/chop) in your browser.

2. Select any location on the map, and then add your memory or commentary. Please make sure that your commentary is coherent and accurately reflects your genuine thoughts about the location.
3. You can use your nick name or a pseudonym when submitting.
4. Press the "submit" button to add your contribution to the database.
5. Take a screenshot that contains the "about location" panel on the bottom-left of the map, which will display your contribution, and share it on this [discussion board](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1612951/discussion_topics/7831389).
