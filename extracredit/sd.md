# Imagining Space using stable diffusion model

**Instructor:** Bo Zhao, 206.685.3846 or zhaobo@uw.edu; **Points Available** = 10

Anna Secor's paper (2012) on topological city offers an understanding of geographic space beyond Euclidean constraints. The paper shows various topological analysis methods for cities and promotes creative thinking on spatial ontology and the city-subject relationship, based on three cinematic cities: The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Midnight in Paris (2011), and Inception (2010).

Based on this paper, we can imagine how an urban space can be twisted, bent, mirrored. Please think aloud, and create images of imaginary spaces using stable diffusion models. Please follow the steps below:

1. Open an web-based stable diffusion model. You can find such an model from https://stablediffusionweb.com/ or https://playgroundai.com/.

2. Input the prompt and then a image will be generated You might want to try out a few prompts and see which one you like the most.
   
3. Please submit a) the image of the imaginary space you generated, b) the prompt, as well as c) a short discussion to this [discussion board](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1612951/discussion_topics/7858841) on canvas. Please describe this AI-generated image and reflect upon this image generating process, does AI can help people to imagine spaces?
